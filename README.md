# 🏋️‍♂️ AI-Powered Personalized Workout & Nutrition Assistant

A smart, privacy-first application that builds workout and nutrition plans based on each user's goals, background, and lifestyle — powered by AI and secured with end-to-end encryption.

## 🌟 Vision

Modern fitness platforms often treat users generically. Our goal is to create a truly personalized system where users input their detailed profile — including age, weight, height, training history, medical background, and daily habits — and get a program uniquely crafted for them. Whether the goal is fat loss, muscle gain, or overall wellness, the system intelligently adapts.

And most importantly: user data is private — even from us.

## 🔐 Privacy & Security First

We take user data seriously. This platform encrypts all sensitive personal information (e.g., user profiles, health history, credentials) at rest and in transit. Even administrators cannot view raw personal data. In the event of a breach, the encrypted data will be unreadable — making the system ultra-secure by design.

Key security highlights:

* All user data is encrypted (using AES-256 or equivalent)
* Passwords are hashed and salted (e.g., bcrypt)
* Admins have no access to decrypted user details
* No plain-text secrets are stored anywhere

## 🧠 Key Features

* AI-powered workout & diet plans tailored to:

  * Height, weight, age
  * Workout history & medical conditions
  * Daily routines and lifestyle
  * User goals (fat loss, bulking, maintenance, etc.)
  * Equipment availability

* (Form analyze by video recording)
* Privacy-focused data handling
* Customizable recommendations that evolve with feedback
* Admin dashboard with role-based controls (no data visibility)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (Planned)
